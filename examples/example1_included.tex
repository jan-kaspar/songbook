\bsong{Hotel California}{Eagles}
[Am]\ On a dark desert highway, [E7]\ cool wind in my hair
[G]\ Warm smell of colitas [D]\ rising up through the air
[F]\ Up ahead in the distance, [C]\ I saw a shimmering light

And I was thinking to myself 
This could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor, 
I thought I heard them say...
