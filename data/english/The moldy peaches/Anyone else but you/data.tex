You're [G]a part time lover and a full time friend
The [C]monkey on you're back is the latest trend
I [G]don't see what anyone can see, in [C]anyone else
... but [G]you.

Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
... but you.

We both have shiny happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
... but you.

You are always trying to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
... but you.

I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
I kiss you all starry eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
... but you.

The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't, you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
... but you.

Du du du du du du dudu
Du du du du du du dudu
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else...
... but you.
