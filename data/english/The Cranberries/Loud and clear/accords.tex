[D#m]I hope that you miss me
[C#]Put me down on history
[A#m]I feel such a reject now
[G#]Get yourself a life

I hope that you're sorry
For not accepting me
For not adoring me
That's why I'm not your wife

\ref
[D#m]People are [C#]stranger
[A#m]People in [G#]danger
People are stranger
People deranged or

I remember there was
Nothing I could ever do
Never could impress you
Even if I tried

\ncol
Tell somebody who cares
Fill the room with empty stares
Go to bed and say my prayers
Keep them satisfied

\annot{chorus}
Loud and clear I make my point my dear

I hope that you never
Get the things you wanted to
Now I cast a spell on you
Complicate your life

Hope you get a puncture
Everywhere you ever drive
Hope the sun beats down on you and
Skin youself alive

\annot{outro}
[D#m]Ra la, la la, la la, laaa
[C#]Ra la, la la, la la, laaa
[A#m]Ra la, la la, la la, laaa
[G#]laaa
