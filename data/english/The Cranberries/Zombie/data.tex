[Em]\ Another [C]head hangs lowly,
[G]child is slowly ta[D]ken.
[Emi]\ And the violence [C]caused such silence.
[G]Who are we mis[D]taken ?
But you [Em]see it's not me, it's not [C]my family,
in your [G]head, in your head they are [D]fighting.

With their [Emi]tanks, and their bombs and their [C]bombs, and their guns
in your [G]head, in your head they are [D]cryin'.
In your [Emi]head, in your [C]head, Zom[G]bie, Zombie, Zom[D]bie - ie - ie.
What's in your [Emi]head, in your [C]head, Zom[G]bie, Zombie, Zomb[D]ie - ie - ie - ie -
[Emi]oh. [C][G][D]


[Em]\ \ Another [C]mother's breakin'
[G]heart is taking o[D]ver.
[Em]\ When the violence [C]causes silence
[G]we must be mista[D]ken.
It's the [Em]same old theme since 1[C]916,
in your [G]head, in your head they're still [D]fightin'.
