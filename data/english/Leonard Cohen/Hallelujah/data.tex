I've [C]heard there was a [Am]secret chord      
that [C]David played and it [Am]pleased the Lord
But [F]you don't really [G]care for music [C]do ya\ [G7]
It [C]goes like this, the [F]fourth, the [E]fifth
the [Am]minor fall and the [F]major lift
The [G]baffled king com[Em]posing halle[Am]lujah

Halle[F]lujah, Halle[Am]lujah, Halle[F]lujah, Halle[C,G,C]lujah\ [G7]


Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Maybe I've been here before
I know this room I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It’s a conan it's a broken hallelujah
 
\ref

There was a time you let me know
Whats real and going on below
But now you never show it to me do you?
I remember when I moved in you
The holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Maybe there's a better bow
Then all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone while I drew you
Its not a cry you can hear at night
Its not somebody whos seen the light
It’s a conan it’s a broken hallelujah
  
\ref

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

\ref
 
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
