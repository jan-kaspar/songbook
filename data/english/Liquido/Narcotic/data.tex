[C]So you face it with a [Dm]smile                                
There is no need to [F]cry
For a trifle's more than [C]this

Will you still recall my name
And the month it all began
Will you release me with a kiss

Have I tried to draw the veil
If I have - how could I fail?
Did I fear the consequence

[C]...dazed by careless [Dm]words         
Cosy in my [F]min[C]d 

\annotate{solo}
[C]I don't [Dm]mind            
I think [F]so         
I will [C]let you go

Now you shaped that liquid wax
Fit it out with crater cracks
Sweet devotion - my delight

Oh, you're such a pretty one
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night

\ncol
"Now I hate to leave you bare
If you need me I'll be there
Don't you ever let me down"

...dazed by careless words
Cosy in my mind

\annot{solo}

And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane

And I called your name
Like an addicted to cocaine calls for
the stuff he'd rather blame

And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane

And I called your name
My cocaine
