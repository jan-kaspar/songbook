[B]Carried away by a [E]moonlight [B]shadow

[B]Carried away by a [E]moonlight [B]shadow.
[E]Lost in a river last [B]Saturday night
[C#m]Far a[A]way on the [B]other side.
He was [E]caught in the middle of

And she [C#m]couldn't find
[A]how to push [B]through

The [C#m]trees that whisper in the [A]evening
[B]Carried away by a [E]moonlight [B]shadow
Sing a [C#m]song of sorrow and [A]grieving
[B]Carried away by a [E]moonlight [B]shadow
[E]All she saw was a [B]silhouette of a gun
[C#m]Far a[A]way on the [B]other side.
He was [E]shot six times by
a [B]man on the run
And she [C#m]couldn't find
[A]how to push [B]through

[B]I stay I pray
I see [E]you in [A]heaven [B]far away
[B]I stay I pray
I see [E]you in [A]heaven [B]far away

Four am in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Star was light in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through
