[C]Time can [G]bring you [Ami]down,
time can [D]bend your [G]knees[D, Emi, D, G]
[C]Time can [G]break your [Ami]heart,
have you [D]begging [G]please [D]begging [E]please

\ref
[F#mi]\ Beyond the [C#]door, there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven...

Would you know my name,
if I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same,
if I saw you in heaven?

\ref
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven...
