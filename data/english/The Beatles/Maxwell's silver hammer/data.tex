[D]Joan was quizzical
[H7]studied metaphysical
[Emi]science in the home
[A7]late nights all alone with a test-tube
[D]oh-oh-oh-[A]oh
[D]Maxwell Edison [H7]majoring in medicine
[Emi]calls her on the phone
"[A7]Can I take you out to the pictures
[D]Joa-oa-oa-[A]oan?"
But [E7]as she's getting ready to go
a [A7]knock comes on the door.

[D]Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
came [E7]down upon her head.
[A7]Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
made [Emi]sure that [A7]she was [D]dead.

Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
teacher gets annoyed
wishing to avoid an unpleasant
sce-e-e-ene
she tells Max to stay
when the class has gone away
so he waits behind
writing 50 times "I must not be
so-o-o-o."
But when she turns her back on the boy
he creeps up from behind.

P.C. Thirty-One
said "We caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
painting testimonial pictures
oh-oh-oh-oh
Rose and Valerie
screaming from the gallery
say he must go free Maxwell must go free
the judge does not agree and he tells them
so-o-o-o
but as the words are leaving his lips
a noise comes from behind.
