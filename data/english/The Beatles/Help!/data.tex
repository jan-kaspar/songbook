[Ami]Help I need somebody [F]help not just anybody
[D7]help you know I need someone [G]help!

[G]\ When I was younger so much [Hmi]younger than today
[Emi]\ I never needed anybody's [Ami]help in [F]any [G]way
[G]\ but now these days are gone I'm [Hmi]not so self assured
[Emi]\ now I find I've changed my mind I've [C]opened [F]up the [G]doors.

\ref [Ami]Help me if you can I'm feeling down
and I [F]do appreciate you being 'round
[D7]help me get my feet back on the ground
won't you [G]please please help me?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
my independence seems to vanish in the haze
but every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.

\ref

= 1.
