When I [C]find myself in [G]times of trouble
[Ami]Mother Mary [F]comes to me
[C]speaking words of [G]wisdom let it [F]be [C/E, Dmi7, C]
and [C]in my hour of [G]darkness
she is [Ami]standing right in [F]front of me
[C]speaking words of [G]wisdom let it [F]be.[C/E, Dmi7, C]

Let it [Ami]be let it [G]be let it [F]be let it [C]be
whisper words of [G]wisdom let it [F]be.[C/E, Dmi7,C]

And when the broken hearted people
living in the world agree
there will be an answer let it be
for though they may be parted
there is still a chance that they will see
there will be an answer let it be.

\annot{R2}
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
there will be an answer let it be.

And when the night is cloudy
there is still a light that shines on me
shine until the morrow let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
speaking words of wisdom let it be.
