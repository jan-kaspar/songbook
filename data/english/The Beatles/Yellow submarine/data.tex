[G]In the [D]town where [C]I was [G]born
[Emi]lived a [Ami]man who [C]sailed to [D]sea
[G]and he [D]told us [C]of his [G]life
[Emi]in the [Ami]land of [C]subma[D]rines.

till we found the sea of green
and we lived beneath the waves
in our Yellow Submarine.

As we live a life of ease
every one of us has all we need

in our Yellow Submarine.
