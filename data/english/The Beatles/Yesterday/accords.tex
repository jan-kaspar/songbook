[C]Yesterday [Hm]\ all my [E]troubles seemed so [Ami]far away
[Am/G] [F]\ now it [G]looks as though they're [F]here to [C]stay
oh [Ami]I be[D]lieve in [F]yester[C]day.

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
there's a shadow hanging over me
oh yesterday came suddenly.

[E]Why she [Ami]had [G]to [F]go I don't [Dmi]know she [G]wouldn't [C]say
[E]I said [Ami]somet[G]hing [F]wrong and I [Dmi]long for [G]yester[C]day.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
now I need a place to hide away
oh I believe in yesterday.
